# OneWayPeggedSidechains

Following **whitepaper** is being developed to increase **interoperability of blockchains**. It is not completed yet. You are welcome to comment it and to give your suggestions and corrections.

This whitepaper proposes common protocol “One way pegged sidechains” that allows to abstract crypto tokens (and other ledger assets) to be transferred between blockchains.  Assets may be abstracted from their “physical carriers” – peer-to-peer networks/blockchains – lifetime of abstract tokens may be longer than lifetime of networks of their emission.

There is demand to increase interoperability between blockchains. Some efforts are made but they rely on trusted party. This document proposes censorship resistant solution using a group signature – the same consensus mechanism Bitcoin uses.

The goal is to develop protocol (stack) general enough to increase the number of blockchain projects that can implement it for standardized way of transferring tokens between blockchains. Open system interconnection Model is used as the guideline.   

This investigation is in Analysis phase yet – gathering requirements. It establishes the directions for definition of protocol (API) but the protocol itself should be defined in Design phase when requirements are clear and stable.
